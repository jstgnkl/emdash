Enforces the sandboxed plugin bundle size caps from RFC 0001 §"Bundle size limits" in both the `bundle` and `publish` CLI flows: total decompressed ≤ 256 KB, per-file decompressed ≤ 128 KB, and at most 20 files per bundle. The previous bundle command capped only the total at 5 MB; the publish command now also re-validates the decompressed tarball before signing the release record so a publisher hits the same cap locally that aggregators enforce at ingest. Bundles between 256 KB and the old 5 MB ceiling will now be rejected — usually a sign the plugin is bundling host-provided dependencies or assets that belong in a CDN rather than the plugin payload.
