"emdash": patch
---

Fixes scheduled 404-log cleanup to run only when the table has grown past its cap. The check uses a bounded sample, so most cron ticks no longer scan the entire `_emdash_404_log` table when there is nothing to evict. This prevents the per-minute cleanup from consuming a large D1 row-read budget for tables that are below the limit.
