Adds a **Change domain** dialog to **Settings > General** for moving a site to a new domain. Before it changes the **Site URL**, EmDash checks that the new domain serves the site. Links in emails and plugins, sitemaps, `robots.txt`, hreflang links, social image URLs, and canonical links set in the SEO panel then use the new domain. If the check can't reach the site, for example on `localhost` or behind a login, the dialog offers to store the address without the check.

The **Site URL** field becomes read-only, and saving **Settings > General** no longer writes it. When `siteUrl`, `EMDASH_SITE_URL`, or `SITE_URL` is set, the page names that address, which links in emails and plugins keep using.

Passkeys only work at the address where they were created. After a move, keep signing in at the old address, or sign in at the new one with an email link and add a passkey there.
