Adds numbered pages to every collection list in the admin. The All and Trash tabs load one page of entries at a time, so a collection opens with 20 entries instead of fetching 100, and both tabs use the Media Library's pagination footer pinned to the bottom of the screen: the entry range, 20, 50, or 100 entries per page, and controls to jump to any page. The Trash badge counts every trashed entry instead of stopping at 50, and every trashed entry is reachable.

Selections persist across pages. Changing the search, a filter, the locale, or the collection clears them.

`GET /_emdash/api/content/{collection}` and `GET /_emdash/api/content/{collection}/trash` accept a 1-based `page` parameter instead of `cursor`. A numbered page returns `total` and no `nextCursor`, and sending both `page` and `cursor` returns a `400` validation error. Cursor pagination is unchanged.

`ContentList` accepts optional `pagination` and `trashPagination` props for numbered pages; without them it behaves as before.
