Adds a video block to the rich text editor. Type `/video` to choose a Media Library video or upload one. Closing the picker leaves an empty video block in place, which you can fill later by clicking it or dropping a video file on it. Video files dropped or pasted anywhere in the text also upload to the Media Library and appear where you dropped them. The video plays in the editor at the width of the text, with a caption field under it and **Replace video** and **Delete video** in its corner. A video's **Used in** tab in the Media Library lists the entries that use it in a video block.

On the site, `Video` from `emdash/ui` renders the `video` block as the browser's own player with its caption. Media Library videos play from your storage's public URL when one is configured, and need the block's `asset.url`: a block without one renders nothing on the site, and the editor shows it as unplayable. A block whose `asset.provider` names a media provider renders from that provider's embed. An empty video block is saved without `asset` and renders nothing.

Uploads follow `maxUploadSize`, 50 MiB by default. The admin's content security policy now allows media from `blob:` and `https:` URLs (`media-src 'self' blob: https:`), as it already did for images. This lets the admin read a video's size before uploading it, and preview a video block whose `asset.url` is on another site. Before, videos uploaded from the admin in production were saved without a width and height.

#### What should I do?

- If a plugin already defines a `video` block, the editor keeps using the plugin's block: it doesn't offer the built-in Video block, and dropped video files aren't uploaded. On the site, the plugin's renderer still wins; a plugin without one gets `Video` for blocks that have only the built-in fields. In TypeScript, narrowing `PortableTextBlock` on `_type === "video"` now gives `PortableTextVideoBlock | PortableTextUnknownBlock`, so reading the plugin's own fields needs a check.
- If you edit Portable Text with `portableTextToProsemirror` and `prosemirrorToPortableText` from `emdash` in your own TipTap editor, add a `videoBlock` node with the attributes `src`, `mediaId`, `provider`, `caption`, `width` and `height` to its schema. `portableTextToProsemirror` turns every built-in video block into that node, and a schema without it can't load the document.
- The media usage API and `emdash/client` can now return the reference type `"portable_text_video"` for a video used in a video block. Code that checks every reference type, or validates the list, needs to accept it.
- With Astro's content security policy turned on and media on another host, allow that host in `media-src`.
